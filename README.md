Raffle Assignment: (Must turn in by EOD Friday)
Create a raffle page that will capture entries in a database and successfully complete upon entry submission. Intended would be to use in on our Magento site. Front-end skinning is not necessary but nice to have.

Requirements:

* Capture name, address, email, VILLA location (Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Reading, Wilmington, Cleveland, Detroit, Rochester, Minneapolis, Dallas or Pittsburgh), and shoe size (6-13) for each entry.
* Create pages for submission and after submission (which includes a successful or unsuccessful message).
* Design of the page doesnâ€™t matter as long as its functional.
* Timestamp each entry.
* Only one entry per email.  If previous entry is found, provide a waring message.
* It should be written in PHP with a MySQL backend (Include both the PHP code and the MySQL database schema creation script).
* Optionally, provide code functions to hook into Magento allowing for admin management and viewing of all entries.

Feel free to ask any questions to enhance usability and back-end management capability.

Thanks,
Karen
